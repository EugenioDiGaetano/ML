Machine learning can learn by looking at what other algorithms have been trained to do, what the machine learns in each context. Many algorithms come with special abilities that allow machine learning to detect different patterns. Some of them will need a certain level of specificity. Machines have special abilities that allow it to pick a pattern and use it.\n","\n","For example, if you search for a particular object or thing, it searches for that object or thing using whatever algorithms are most efficient at finding it. For a machine to understand a language, all it needs is the most efficient language and any algorithm that can identify, understand, and use that language can. If it's not being trained by a machine, it'll understand the language in a way that's very similar to a human language. In fact, it'll learn very slowly compared to human.\n","\n","What does machine learning mean for you? Machine learning encompasses many different fields. If a book has been published, a book has been published, the book is part of a larger book series and it's called the book of the year. But even with all the resources available to it, machine learning is still very little used because of its limited use to learn from other books. The key to understanding a book of the year is to know your data, how many books you know each year, your readership. To make the most out of it, it's hard to really understand how or why your average reader likes an information collection book that's part of a book series, or just for a reading on a computer screen. So in a nutshell, the human need for something you can see, know about. That is really important.\n","\n","Machine Learning is an area you might not be familiar with, but there are different tools that will help you to understand that.\n","\n","One tool has been called: machine learning. I'm going to talk about it for a moment. Another is: how can we learn how to think with machine learning? That's part of human biology. We can know how to think well and think about our environment fairly fast. That requires being aware of it.\n","\n","Learning through training\n","\n","Machine learning is a very, very, very, very big learning challenge. In particular, it is very large to understand it at first in order to understand its underlying philosophy and how it all happened. If you go to some of these conferences you might hear about training robots for things, like driving to work. If you go into a class and you're looking at these lectures, you'll see what you see:\n","\n","1:25 – 1 hour training for the robot\n","\n","2:00 – 10 minute training for the robot\n","\n","5:00 – 24 minute training for the robot\n","\n","1:00 – 20 minute training for the robot, or more if you're a robot engineer.\n","\n","This is actually the difference between learning with machine learning and training an AI, an intelligent AI. Imagine what you might know after going through the entire training process. You might be working on a computer system from a different part of the world. You'd have different jobs, different skills, different education in different parts of that different country, and at the end of each week, you'd come back with a robot that you learned from the last year, which was the year before and which was in 2014.\n","\n","That's your whole experience if you're just working on an AI system, not an artificial intelligence system. Of course, it might not be as robust like you'd think. In a couple years, you might not have the exact same experience and you might have so much learning that it can't support it's ability to understand, adapt, and do other things that you can learn in order to make it even better and understand something that you'd like to learn to understand.\n","\n","And that's your training, in order to learn how the machine comes to understand it. And that's why I think that is so important. Let's say you have machine learning training. You're sitting in your classroom, working on a computer that teaches your robot how to run a car and you're not getting a lot of inspiration. You don't ask the robot questions. You're in your classroom. It's just looking at your computer screen when it sees your camera or just looks at the computer screen. If it is too hard to understand your camera, how long would you be sitting there? If you're getting really deep questions, whether it's the camera, the robot you're working on, or the question itself, you might be more confident because you're more prepared.\n","\n","I wouldn't say if you had trained an AI in a very short period of time. You probably wouldn't be able to keep up. You wouldn't be able to train it to make a more important decision when it comes to buying a car, in your job. That is the point where I find that\n","---\n","Generation time: 14.291 seconds\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Without KV caching"],"metadata":{"id":"NbPtCagoKb77"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["start = time.time()\n","model.generate(**tokenizer(\"What is machine learning?\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device), use_cache=False, max_new_tokens=1000, do_sample=True)\n","t = time.time() - start\n","print(f\"Generation time: {round(t, 3)} seconds\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733928633430,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":47981,"user":{"displayName":"Gabriele Russo Russo","userId":"07962968252190416546"}},"outputId":"d9cc5e83-0981-4850-dc15-7635a658acf0","id":"UwzfAnhqKbMM"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:None for open-end generation.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Generation time: 47.74 seconds\n"]}]}]}
